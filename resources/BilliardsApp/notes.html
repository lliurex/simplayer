<p class="introduction">
Physics-based simulation of 2D billiard balls, using the
<a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
You can also regard this as air hockey pucks on a table.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
Click near an object to exert a force with your mouse.
Try changing gravity, elasticity (bounciness), and damping (friction).
</p>  


<p>Experiments to try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check whether energy is conserved: turn on "show energy". You'll need to set
    damping=0 and elasticity=1.</li>

  <li>Try using different collision methods, such as "simultaneous". Is the simulation
  still realistic?
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Note that this is a 2D simulation and doesn't treat important aspects of real world
billiard balls such as friction and rotation or spin. The balls do not spin in this
simulation because edge friction is not calculated, so collisions are essentially
friction-less.
</p>

<p>The <a href="collision-methods-en.html">method of collision handling</a> for this
simulation is important. Using the "simultaneous" method gives symmetric and
non-realistic results. The linked article discusses why different methods of
calculating the result of collisions are needed.

<!--h2>TO DO:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Remove "thrust" control</li>
  <li>Explain "offset" control</li>
  <li>Remove decorations from objects (drag dot and center of mass)</li>
  <li>Make drag point be at center</li>
  <li>Links to other simulations and articles</li>
  <li>Faster initial velocity.  Make initial velocity settable as a parameter.</li>
</ul-->
