<p class="introduction">
Interactive simulation showing objects with mutual gravitational force pulling them
together. Uses the <a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">myPhysicsLab 2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
Click near an object to exert a spring force with your mouse or finger. Click
<b>rebuild</b> to get a new set of randomly sized objects. Try changing gravity,
elasticity (bounciness), and damping (friction).
</p>

<p>Turn on the <b>show forces</b> checkbox to see the gravitational forces between the
center of mass of each object and the contact forces where objects touch each other.
