<p class="introduction">
Physics-based simulation of a pendulum, showing both a phase graph and the direction
field (or slope field) associated with the differential equation.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
Click the "Sim" tab to access parameters such as: gravity, mass or friction (damping).
Drag the pendulum to change the starting position. Or click below to set some
predefined initial conditions.

<p>See the page about the
<a href="pendulum-en.html">single pendulum</a>
for more about how pendulums work and the math behind this simulation. This simulation
is identical to that one, but adds a graph of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field">direction field</a>
(AKA slope field) of the differential equation.  This direction field is shown
overlapping the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space">phase space</a>
graph of angular velocity vs. angle.  At each point, the path of the pendulum in phase
space is along the direction field.</p>

<h2>Experiments to try:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Notice that the path through phase space is always along the direction field.</li>
  <li>Which parameters (damping, gravity, mass, length) change the direction field?
     Why do they or don't they change the direction field?</li>
    <li>Try bigger faster motions of the pendulum (drag the pendulum to a high starting
     point, or give it a high start velocity).  Notice that it still moves along the
     direction field in phase space.</li>
  <li>Turn on "show energy".  When is kinetic energy highest?  When is potential energy
    highest?</li>
</ul>
