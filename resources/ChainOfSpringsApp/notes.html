<p class="introduction">
This simulation shows a chain of springs and masses with fixed attachment points. The
fixed attachment points are moveable by the user, and the right attachment point can be
removed entirely.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
You can change number of chain links, gravity, mass, spring stiffness, and damping
(friction). You can drag an individual mass or the endpoints with your mouse. You can
remove the right fixed attachment point.
</p>

<p>The math and physics of this simulation are very similar to what is shown for
<a href="2d-spring-en.html">2D Spring</a> and
<a href="double-2d-spring-en.html">Double 2D Spring</a>. Those calculations are repeated
for each spring and mass involved.

which is <a href="../develop/docs/Customizing.html">more customizable</a>.
