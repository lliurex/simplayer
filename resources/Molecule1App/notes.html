<p class="introduction">
This simulation shows 2 masses connected by a spring and free to move in 2 dimensions.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
You can change parameters in the simulation such as gravity, mass, spring stiffness, and friction (damping).  You can drag any mass with your mouse to change the starting position. 
</p>

<p>The math and physics used in this simulation are similar to the 
<a href="2d-spring-en.html">2-D Spring</a> and
<a href="double-2d-spring-en.html">Double 2-D Spring</a> simulations. However the masses
can also collide with the walls; the collision handling is similar to the
<a href="collide-blocks-en.html">Colliding Blocks</a> simulation. The only novel bit of
math occurs when a mass is pinned against a wall: in that case we add up the net forces
on the mass and set the acceleration to zero if necessary.</p>
