<p class="introduction">
Physics based simulation of a simple automobile suspension in 2D using the
<a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
The car body is represented by a rectangular block, the wheels by 2 small circles.  The car body has about 10 times more mass than the wheels.
</p>


<p class="instructions">
Drag the car with your mouse.  Use the arrow keys to apply a thrust force to the car. Change parameters such as gravity, car mass, wheel mass, spring stiffness, and friction (damping).
</p>  

<p>
There are two configurations of the car:  in one the wheels are attached only by springs;  in the other the wheels are attached by a rigid rod and also a spring.  There is a menu to choose the configuration.
</p>

<p>Note that the springs have a dampimg parameter that operates only when the spring is compressed or expanded.  The other damping parameter slows down the motion of the bodies thru space.

<a href="../develop/docs/myphysicslab.sims.engine2D.CarSuspensionApp.html">documentation</a> and a
<a href="../develop/build/sims/engine2D/CarSuspensionApp-en.html">simple-compiled version</a>
which is <a href="../develop/docs/Customizing.html">more customizable</a>.

<!--h2>TO DO:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make rod a separate object from wheels, so that wheels can collide with car body.</li>
</ul-->
