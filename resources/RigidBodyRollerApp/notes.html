<p class="introduction">
This physics-based simulation shows a rigid body attached to a curved "roller coaster" path. Uses the myPhysicsLab
<a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
Click with your mouse to apply a spring force to the block. Several path shapes are
available. Try changing gravity or damping.
</p>

<p>This simulation uses the same math shown on the
<a href="rigid-body-roller-en.html">roller coaster</a> page to make a numerical table of the path data. A special kind of joint connector called
<a href="../develop/docs/myphysicslab.lab.engine2D.PathJoint.html">PathJoint</a>
is used to connect the rigid body to the path.
</p>

<p>The "circle" path has a 
<a href="../develop/docs/myphysicslab.lab.engine2D.PathEndPoint.html">PathEndPoint</a>
which stops the movement of the PathJoint from going past the top of the circle. The PathEndPoint is not required, it is added as a demonstration.
</p>

<p>The "hump" path has two PathEndPoints, and also defines a
<a href="../develop/docs/myphysicslab.lab.util.GenericMemo.html">GenericMemo</a>
which disconnects the block when it moves past a certain spot on the path.
</p>
