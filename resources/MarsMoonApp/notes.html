<p class="introduction">
Simulation of an asteroid orbiting a moon using the
<a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
</p>

<p>See if you can find the asteroid initial velocity that results in a nearly circular
orbit without collisions.

<!--
<p class="instructions">
You can change parameters such as gravity, moon mass, asteroid mass, initial asteroid velocity, damping, and elasticity of collisions.
</p>  
<ul>
   Ovalness:  ratio of moon's width to height.  A value of 1.0 gives a circle. (effective only after reset).
  Moon Spin:  initial rotational velocity of the moon (effective only after reset).
  <li>Velocity:  initial vertical velocity of asteroid  (effective only after reset).</li>
  <li>Elasticity:  1.0 gives perfectly elastic collisions;  0 gives inelastic collisions.</li>
  <li>Damping:  slows moving objects according to their velocity.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why does Phobos have parallel lines etched into its surface?</em> </p>

<p>This simulation was suggested by Kenneth Ramsley at Brown University in 2011 regarding
his ideas about the Mars moon Phobos. You can see these lines in the photo above. Ken's
idea is that Phobos would occasionally capture a small asteroid which would orbit
Phobos but keep bumping into it, similar to what is seen in the above simulation.

How the Mars Moon Phobos Got Its Grooves</a>
</p>

<p>Although it looks like the large moon in the simulation is stationary, it is actually
moving. This is because the asteroid exerts a small gravitational pull on the large
moon. You can confirm that the large moon is moving in a couple of ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn on the "pan-zoom" checkbox and click the "+" button to zoom in till you see
  the center of the moon up very close.</li>
  
  <li>Set the graph to see the moon's position: choose "moon y position" and "moon x
  position" for the variables to graph.</li>
</ul>
