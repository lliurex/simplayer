<p class="introduction">
Physics-based simulation of a chain of several rigid bodies connected by flexible
joints, using the
<a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
Click near an object to exert a force with your mouse.
Try changing gravity, elasticity (bounciness), and damping (friction).
</p>  

<p>Experiments to try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does gravity affect the shape of the curve of the resting chain?</li>
  <li>Does the simulation behave like a real chain?  Does it sometimes "snap"
     violently?</li>
  <li>Turn on "show energy".  When is kinetic energy highest?</li>
  <li>Turn on "show forces" to see the contact forces or tension. Why does tension
  vary? How does the varying tension relate to the relative amount of kinetic or
  potential energy?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The resting chain follows a curve called a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary">Catenary</a>.
  With calculus you can predict this curve.
</p>

<p>Each chain link is a single rigid body. There are "joints" attaching each chain link
to its neighbors or to the background.
</p>

<!--p>The <a href="../engine2D/collision-methods-en.html">method of collision handling</a> for this
simulation is not important because there are generally no collisions between chain
links, only contact forces.
</p-->

<p>Also available are:
<a href="https://github.com/myphysicslab/myphysicslab/blob/master/src/sims/engine2D/ChainApp.js">open source code</a>,
<a href="../develop/docs/myphysicslab.sims.engine2D.ChainApp.html">documentation</a> and a
<a href="../develop/build/sims/engine2D/ChainApp-en.html">simple-compiled version</a>
which is <a href="../develop/docs/Customizing.html">more customizable</a>.
</p>


<!--h2>TO DO:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Set zero energy for each link to be where it is when at rest</li>
  <li>add 1 or more free ball or block, to play with, and allow changing mass of that
    ball/block. Maybe on a separate page have that be the default.
  </li>
  <li>show the catenary curve in background?  Maybe have a checkbox for that.</li>
  <li>Reset button does NOT put the chains at rest, could calculate from catenary
    equation.
  </li>
  <li>Show the catenary equation, and point out that gravity doesn't appear</li>
  <li>Give link to page explaining how joints work</li>
  <li>Links to other simulations and articles</li>
</ul-->
