<p>The physics simulations shown on myPhysicsLab</a>
fall into two categories</p>

<ol>
<li>Specialized - designed for one particular mechanism</li>
<li>General - uses the <em>2D rigid body physics engine</em> which can simulate just
   about any configuration</li>
</ol>

<p>An example in the "specialized" category is the
  <a href="../CartPendulumApp/CartPendulumApp-ca.html">cart + pendulum</a>. That simulation works well, but it
  <em>can only ever simulate that particular mechanism</em>.
  You can vary the length of the pendulum, the mass of the objects, or spring
  stiffness. But you can't change how the parts are connected, or apply new forces, or
  collide with another object.
</p>

<p>In contrast, the Rigid Body Physics Engine can model a wide variety of mechanisms.
  For example, here is the
  <a href="../CartPendulum2App/CartPendulum2App-ca.html">cart + pendulum using the physics engine</a>.
  Notice that you can drag the cart or pendulum by
  pressing the mouse button to activate a spring force -- this is not possible
  in the specialized version of the simulation.
<p>

<p>It is remarkable that the Rigid Body Physics Engine is able to model so many
  different mechanisms with good accuracy.  Here are some more examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../DoublePendulumApp/DoublePendulumApp-ca.html">Specialized Double Pendulum</a> versus
    <a href="../DoublePendulum2App/DoublePendulum2App-ca.html">Double Pendulum using Physics Engine</a>.
    Notice that in the physics engine version you can apply spring forces or collide
    the free block into the double pendulum.
  </li>

  <li><a href="../CompareDoublePendulumApp/CompareDoublePendulumApp-ca.html">Compare Double Pendulum</a>
    shows side-by-side a specialized double pendulum and a physics engine version. Note
    that they stay in sync for a long time. But you can interact with the physics
    engine version, applying a spring force with your mouse.
  </li>

  <li><a href="../RigidBodyRollerApp/RigidBodyRollerApp-ca.html">RigidBody Roller Coaster</a>
    shows that the physics engine can handle situations similar to the
    <a href="../RollerSingleApp/RollerSingleApp-ca.html">specialized roller coaster</a> simulations.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>About the Physics Engine</h2>

<p>The physics engine is composed of three classes that can be used separately
   (though we almost always use the last one).
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The
    RigidBodySim class
    handles moving rigid bodies by applying forces to them such
     as springs, gravity, damping.
  See <a href="../RigidBodyApp/RigidBodyApp-ca.html">Rigid Body Forces</a> for the math.
  </li>

  <li>The
    ImpulseSim class
    extends RigidBodySim, adding collision handling.
    See <a href="../ImpulseApp/ImpulseApp-ca.html">Rigid Body Collisions</a> for the math.
    See CollisionAdvance
    which manages the collision handling process.
  </li>

  <li>The
    ContactSim class
    extends ImpulseSim, adding contact forces that allow
    objects to push against each other.
    See <a href="../ContactApp/ContactApp-ca.html">Rigid Body Contact Forces</a> for the math.
  </li>

</ol>

<p>More information about how the rigid body physics engine works is described in several places:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2D Physics Engine Overview
  </li>

  <li>myPhysicsLab Documentation has detailed
    information about the software.
  </li>

  <li><a href="../CollisionCombo/CollisionCombo-ca.html">Collision Handling Methods</a> discusses
    various schemes for handling collisions in rigid body simulations.
  </li>

  <li><a href="../ReactionPendulumApp/ReactionPendulumApp-ca.html">Reaction Forces Pendulum</a> is an example
    of finding contact forces for a specific simple mechanism (the pendulum)
    instead of using the general (and complex) physics engine.
  </li>
</ul>
