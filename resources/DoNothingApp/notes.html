<p class="introduction">
Physics-based simulation of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trammel_of_Archimedes">trammel of Archimedes</a>,
also known as a "do nothing machine" or "do nothing grinder".
Uses the <a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.

<p class="instructions">
Click near the handle with your mouse to apply a spring force. Turn on "extra block" to
see the mechanism collide with another block. Try changing elasticity or damping. Set
"handle force" to apply a constant force to the handle. Set "force rotation rate" to
zero to have the mechanism reach a high rate of speed. Turn on "show forces" to see the
various forces at work.
