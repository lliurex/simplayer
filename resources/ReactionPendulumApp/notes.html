<p class="introduction">
Simulation of a pendulum using reaction forces (on left in red), along with a
comparison simulation using the equations of motion (on right in blue).
</p>

<p class="instructions">
You can change parameters in the simulation such as gravity, starting angle, length of
the rod, radius of the disk, mass, and separation between the two pendulums.
</p>

<p>This contrasts two very different ways of solving the same simulation:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the <em>equations of motion</em> using Newton's equations of motion.
    The blue pendulum on the right does this, it is the same simulation as the
    <a href="pendulum-en.html">ideal pendulum</a>; see that page for the math.
  </li>
  <li>Calculate the <em>reaction forces</em> needed at each moment to maintain the
    pivot point at the same location. The red pendulum on the left does this.
    The reaction forces are visible as the dashed green lines.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The "classic" blue pendulum is the theoretically correct solution. So it is a good
check that the reaction force pendulum is working correctly.
</p>

<p>The pendulum is regarded as a rigid body consisting of a uniform disk at end of a
massless rigid arm. We find the reaction forces by solving a matrix equation, following
the steps shown on the <a href="../contact.html">rigid body contact forces</a> page.
</p>

<p>The math used here is the same as that used by the
<a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>. But this simulation
is "hard-coded" for this particular setup. In contrast, the physics engine is far more
capable: it is designed to work on any group of rigid bodies, connected by joints,
springs, ropes, or rods, handling any forces applied to the bodies, as well as
collisions.
</p>

<p>The point of this simulation is to show a simpler example of the math involved in
finding contact forces. This is an example of finding contact forces without
writing a highly general (and complex) physics engine.
</p>

<p>To match the motion of the two simulations, the length of the rods are slightly
different. This is necessary because the reaction force pendulum models the pendulum as
a rigid disc with mass distributed evenly, whereas the classic ideal pendulum models
the pendulum as a point mass at the end of a massless rod. See the
<a href="../develop/docs/myphysicslab.sims.pendulum.ReactionPendulumApp.html">ReactionPendulumApp documentation</a>
for how the equivalent lengths are calculated.
