<p class="introduction">
Physics-based simulation of a cart moving along a horizontal track with a pendulum
suspended from it. Uses the
<a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
</p>

<p class="instructions">
Click near an object to exert a spring force with your mouse.
Try changing gravity, spring stiffness, elasticity and damping (friction).
</p>

<p>Try setting the spring stiffness to zero to see the cart collide with the walls.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="../pendulum/cart-pendulum-en.html">specialized version of the
cart + pendulum</a> which does not use the general physics engine.
</p>

<p>Also available are:
<a href="https://github.com/myphysicslab/myphysicslab/blob/master/src/sims/engine2D/CartPendulum2App.js">open source code</a>,
<a href="../develop/docs/myphysicslab.sims.engine2D.CartPendulum2App.html">documentation</a> and a
<a href="../develop/build/sims/engine2D/CartPendulum2App-en.html">simple-compiled version</a>
which is <a href="../develop/docs/Customizing.html">more customizable</a>.
