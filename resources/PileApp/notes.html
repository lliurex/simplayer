<p class="introduction">
Demonstration of a pile of objects falling into a corner 
using the <a href="../explain/physics-engine-en.html">2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</a>.
</p>

<p>This is a good stress test for the physics engine. Click the <b>add block</b>
button to add more blocks. Eventually the simulation will be unable to keep up with
real time.
</p>

<p>To see whether the simulation is keeping up with real time click the
<b>show clock</b> button. The clock shows two second hands: the red hand tracks real
time and the blue hand tracks simulation time. When the red hand is ahead of the blue
hand it means the simulation has fallen behind real time.
</p>

<p>The <b>connected blocks</b> checkbox includes two blocks that are connected by
joints. Those are a good test of the ability to to keep joints together during a series
of violent collisions.
</p>

<p>Enabling the <b>endless loop</b> checkbox causes the simulation to be rebuilt every
few seconds. The period is set by the <b>loop time</b> amount. This allows running the
simulation over and over which is a good way to test the physics engine with many
random situations.
</p>

<p>The main performance challenge is when the blocks have settled down and are all
lying in contact. Enable the <b>show forces</b> checkbox to see how hard the physics
engine is working to figure out the many contact forces.
</p>

<p>The physics engine performance is proportional to the the <i>number of connected
contacts raised to the fourth power</i>. Here is an experiment that shows this:
</p>

<ol>

<li>Set the <b>number of blocks</b> to 15, and notice that the simulation cannot keep
up with real time once the blocks have settled into the corner. With 15 blocks there
are around 60 contact forces, and 60^4 = 12,960,000.
</li>

<li>Enable the <b>two piles</b> checkbox. Now the simulation <i>can</i> keep up with
real time because there are two piles instead of one. With 7 or 8 blocks in each pile
there are around 30 contacts in each pile, and 2*(30^4) = 1,620,000 which is an order
of magnitude less calculations needed.
</li>

</ol>
